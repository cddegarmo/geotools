# geotools
##### About
This program is designed to facilitate several petroleum geology workflows. It currently contains a utility class for calculating
reservoir volumetrics (either in bbls oil in place or mcf of gas in place), as well as a command line tool for calculating water saturation for a 
given reservoir. 

More tools will be added as this project evolves. A recently added tool is a command line program that sorts workover candidates in a water/CO2 flooded field.

##### Get started
After compiling, the tools can be run from PrioritizeWorkovers or WaterSaturation, depending on which one you want to use.
